## Overview

Voice Emotion Detection is a project aimed at recognizing emotions from audio recordings of human speech. This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build and deploy a machine learning model capable of detecting emotions from voice recordings.

## Features

- Emotion detection from audio recordings.
- Support for multiple emotions including happiness, sadness, anger, etc.
- Easily customizable model architecture and hyperparameters.
- Ability to preprocess audio data and extract relevant features.
- Supports training, validation, and testing of the emotion detection model.
- Integration of text and voice tone analysis for comprehensive emotion recognition.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/voice-emotion-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd voice-emotion-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
   - Ensure your dataset consists of audio recordings labeled with corresponding emotions.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

2. Preprocess the audio data:
   - Extract relevant features from the audio recordings, such as pitch, intensity, and duration.
   - Normalize the features as necessary.

3. Train the emotion detection model:
   - Adjust model architecture and hyperparameters in the provided scripts if needed.
   - Run the training script:

     ```
     python train.py --data_path /path/to/training_data
     ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   - Validate the trained model on a separate validation dataset:

     ```
     python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --data_path /path/to/validation_data
     ```

   - Test the model performance on unseen data:

     ```
     python test.py --model_path /path/to/saved_model --data_path /path/to/testing_data
     ```

5. Integrate with other applications:
   - Utilize the trained model in your applications for real-time or batch emotion detection from voice recordings.
